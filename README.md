# mtg-card-price-updater

A script that updates card prices in an Excel spreadsheet

## Premise

Have a Magic the Gathering collection? Wanna know how much your cards are worth according to CardMarket? 

Look no further, because this script will help you update the prices of your MTG collection.
Just list all your cards in an Excel spreadsheet (example: album.xlsx) and run the script.
No more searching prices, single card by card, for hours, only for the data to be outdated for a few months.

## P.S.

openpyxl library needs to be installed
selenium library needs to be installed
